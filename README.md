# Scripts
My personal repository of scripts I made. This repo was intended to be private (becuase I highly doubt if anyone would ever use these), but I made it public anyways. So feel free to use them. If anyone needs a custom script, you can ask... I'll try my best. (But bear in mind I'm not much of a 'bash' guy, I like Python, so most of stuff here will be python3).
